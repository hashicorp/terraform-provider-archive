## 2.4.0 (June 07, 2023)

NOTES:

* This Go module has been updated to Go 1.19 per the [Go support policy](https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#policy). Any consumers building on earlier Go versions may experience errors. ([#200](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-archive/issues/200))

ENHANCEMENTS:

* data-source/archive_file: Added attribute `exclude_symlink_directories` which will exclude symbolically linked directories from the archive when set to true. Defaults to false ([#183](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-archive/issues/183))
* resource/archive_file: Added attribute `exclude_symlink_directories` which will exclude symbolically linked directories from the archive when set to true. Defaults to false ([#183](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-archive/issues/183))

BUG FIXES:

* data-source/archive_file: Symbolically linked directories are included in archives by default rather than generating an error ([#183](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-archive/issues/183))
* resource/archive_file: Symbolically linked directories are included in archives by default rather than generating an error ([#183](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-archive/issues/183))

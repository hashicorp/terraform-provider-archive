<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `output_path` (String) The output of the archive file.
- `type` (String) The type of archive to generate. NOTE: `zip` is supported.

### Optional

- `exclude_symlink_directories` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating whether symbolically linked directories should be excluded during the creation of the archive. Defaults to `false`.
- `excludes` (Set of String) Specify files to ignore when reading the `source_dir`.
- `output_file_mode` (String) String that specifies the octal file mode for all archived files. For example: `"0666"`. Setting this will ensure that cross platform usage of this module will not vary the modes of archived files (and ultimately checksums) resulting in more deterministic behavior.
- `source` (Block Set) Specifies attributes of a single source file to include into the archive. One and only one of `source`, `source_content_filename` (with `source_content`), `source_file`, or `source_dir` must be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--source))
- `source_content` (String) Add only this content to the archive with `source_content_filename` as the filename. One and only one of `source`, `source_content_filename` (with `source_content`), `source_file`, or `source_dir` must be specified.
- `source_content_filename` (String) Set this as the filename when using `source_content`. One and only one of `source`, `source_content_filename` (with `source_content`), `source_file`, or `source_dir` must be specified.
- `source_dir` (String) Package entire contents of this directory into the archive. One and only one of `source`, `source_content_filename` (with `source_content`), `source_file`, or `source_dir` must be specified.
- `source_file` (String) Package this file into the archive. One and only one of `source`, `source_content_filename` (with `source_content`), `source_file`, or `source_dir` must be specified.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The sha1 checksum hash of the output.
- `output_base64sha256` (String) Base64 Encoded SHA256 checksum of output file
- `output_base64sha512` (String) Base64 Encoded SHA512 checksum of output file
- `output_md5` (String) MD5 of output file
- `output_sha` (String) SHA1 checksum of output file
- `output_sha256` (String) SHA256 checksum of output file
- `output_sha512` (String) SHA512 checksum of output file
- `output_size` (Number) The byte size of the output archive file.

### Nested Schema for `source`

Required:

- `content` (String) Add this content to the archive with `filename` as the filename.
- `filename` (String) Set this as the filename when declaring a `source`.

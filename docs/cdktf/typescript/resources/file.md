<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `outputPath` (String) The output of the archive file.
- `type` (String) The type of archive to generate. NOTE: `zip` and `tar.gz` is supported.

### Optional

- `excludeSymlinkDirectories` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating whether symbolically linked directories should be excluded during the creation of the archive. Defaults to `false`.
- `excludes` (Set of String) Specify files/directories to ignore when reading the `sourceDir`. Supports glob file matching patterns including doublestar/globstar (`**`) patterns.
- `outputFileMode` (String) String that specifies the octal file mode for all archived files. For example: `"0666"`. Setting this will ensure that cross platform usage of this module will not vary the modes of archived files (and ultimately checksums) resulting in more deterministic behavior.
- `source` (Block Set) Specifies attributes of a single source file to include into the archive. One and only one of `source`, `sourceContentFilename` (with `sourceContent`), `sourceFile`, or `sourceDir` must be specified. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--source))
- `sourceContent` (String) Add only this content to the archive with `sourceContentFilename` as the filename. One and only one of `source`, `sourceContentFilename` (with `sourceContent`), `sourceFile`, or `sourceDir` must be specified.
- `sourceContentFilename` (String) Set this as the filename when using `sourceContent`. One and only one of `source`, `sourceContentFilename` (with `sourceContent`), `sourceFile`, or `sourceDir` must be specified.
- `sourceDir` (String) Package entire contents of this directory into the archive. One and only one of `source`, `sourceContentFilename` (with `sourceContent`), `sourceFile`, or `sourceDir` must be specified.
- `sourceFile` (String) Package this file into the archive. One and only one of `source`, `sourceContentFilename` (with `sourceContent`), `sourceFile`, or `sourceDir` must be specified.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The sha1 checksum hash of the output.
- `outputBase64Sha256` (String) Base64 Encoded SHA256 checksum of output file
- `outputBase64Sha512` (String) Base64 Encoded SHA512 checksum of output file
- `outputMd5` (String) MD5 of output file
- `outputSha` (String) SHA1 checksum of output file
- `outputSha256` (String) SHA256 checksum of output file
- `outputSha512` (String) SHA512 checksum of output file
- `outputSize` (Number) The byte size of the output archive file.

### Nested Schema for `source`

Required:

- `content` (String) Add this content to the archive with `filename` as the filename.
- `filename` (String) Set this as the filename when declaring a `source`.
